The MSP debug stack (MSPDS) for all MSP430(TM) microcontrollers (MCUs)
and SimpleLink(TM) MSP432(TM) devices consists of a static library on
the host system side as well as an embedded firmware that runs on debug
tools including the MSP-FET, MSP-FET430UIF or on-board eZ debuggers.

It is the bridging element between all PC software and all MSP430 and
SimpleLink MSP432 microcontroller derivatives and handles tasks such as
code download, stepping through code or break points.

The MSP Debug Stack is used in integrated development environments such
as Code Composer Studio(TM) (CCS), IAR's Embedded Workbench or tools
like Smart RF Studio and Elprotronic's FlashPro430.
