XFiles relies on the presence of two script in the $PATH: xfilesctl and
xfilesthumb.  xfilesctl responds to user interactions, while xfilesthumb
generates thumbnails as 64x64 ppm at $XDG_CACHE_HOME/thumbnails (usually
~/.cache/thumbnails/.)

Both scripts act as configuration for XFiles and should be manually
written by the user.  Examples that can be used as template for building
your own can be found at ${LOCALBASE}/share/examples/xfiles/.

Additional packages need to be installed for the example scripts to
work.  For example, the provided xfilesthumb example script depends on
ImageMagick and ffmpegthumbnailer to generate video thumbnails; and the
provided xfilesctl example script depends on dmenu to display an URL bar
for typing paths and xmenu for the context menu.

XFiles theme can be customized with X resources.  An example resources
file is installed at ${LOCALBASE}/share/examples/xfiles/Xresources.
